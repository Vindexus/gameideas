# Dice Damage
Damage is done with RPG style dice notation. This gives us the ability to have many cool dice-related buffs to damage.


Example ability:
>**Fireball**: Deals 3d10 to a random target.

Below are **damage buffs** that make damage rolls deal more damage.

## Honed (X)
Die rolls of less than X count as X.

Honed (4): You Fireball and roll 6, 2, 7. Your damage will be 6+4+7.

## Penetration (X)
Ignore up to X of the target's Resistance (see below)

## Tearing (X)
Roll X extra dice and discard the X lowest rolls.

Tearing (2): Your Fireball rolls 5d10 and discard the lowest 2 rolls. You roll 10, 6, 7, 8, 4. Your 6 and 4 get dropped so your total is 10+7+8.

## Relentless (X)
Reroll up to X 1s on your attack roll.

Relentless (2): You roll a 8,3,10. No 1s are rolled so your damage is 8+3+10.
